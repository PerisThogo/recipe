                    <p>Enjoy with beef or chicken stew</p>
                    <details>
                        <summary>View Recipe</summary>
                        <p>
                            Ingredients (Makes about 8 chapatis) <br><br>
                            2 cups all-purpose flour or whole wheat flour (atta)<br>
                            ¾ cup warm water (adjust as needed)<br>
                            1 tablespoon vegetable oil or melted butter<br>
                            ½ teaspoon salt<br>
                            Extra flour for dusting<br>
                            Extra oil or butter (optional, for brushing)<br><br>

                            Instructions<br><br>
                            Mix the Dough:
                            In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the oil and mix well. Gradually add warm water while kneading until a soft, smooth dough forms (not too sticky or too dry).<br><br>
                            
                            Rest the Dough:<br><br>
                            Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes. This helps make the chapatis soft.<br><br>
                            
                            Divide & Roll:<br><br>
                            Divide the dough into 8 equal balls. Lightly dust a surface with flour and roll each ball into a thin, round shape (about 6-8 inches in diameter).<br><br>
                            
                            Cook the Chapati:<br><br>
                            Heat a dry pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Place one chapati on the pan and cook for about 30 seconds or until you see bubbles forming. Flip it over and cook the other side for another 30 seconds. Flip again, gently pressing with a spatula or cloth to help it puff up.<br><br>
                            
                            Keep Warm & Serve:<br><br>
                            Remove from the pan and place in a clean kitchen towel to keep warm. Brush with butter or oil for extra softness (optional). Repeat for the remaining chapatis.<br><br>
                            
                            Serving Suggestions:<br><br>
                            Enjoy with beef or chicken stew, sukuma wiki, beans, or even a simple spread of butter and honey.<br><br>
                            Serve hot for the best taste and texture!<br><br>

                        Ingredients (Serves 4-5) <br>
                            - 2 cups rice (Basmati or long-grain rice works best) <br>
                            - 4 cups water or vegetable broth <br>
                            - 2 tablespoons cooking oil or butter <br>
                            - 1 onion, finely chopped <br>
                            - 2 cloves garlic, minced <br>
                            - 1 teaspoon ginger, grated <br>

                            - ½ cup bell peppers (red, green, or yellow), diced <br>
                            - ½ cup sweet corn (optional) <br>
                            - 1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste) <br>
                            - ½ teaspoon black pepper <br>
                            - 1 teaspoon turmeric (for color, optional) <br>
                            - 1 teaspoon cumin or curry powder (optional, for extra flavor) <br>
                            - Fresh coriander/cilantro for garnish <br><br>
                            
                            Instructions <br><br>
                            
                            1. Prepare the Rice: <br>
                               Rinse the rice under running water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents stickiness. <br><br>
                            
                            2. Sauté the Aromatics: <br>
                               Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until soft and translucent. Stir in the garlic and ginger, cooking for another minute. <br><br>
                            
                            3. Cook the Vegetables: <br>
                               Add the diced carrots, peas, bell peppers, and corn. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until they start to soften. <br><br>
                            
                            4. Season & Add Rice: <br>
                               Sprinkle salt, black pepper, turmeric, and cumin/curry powder. Mix well. Add the rinsed rice and stir to coat it with the flavors. <br><br>
                            
                            5. Add Water & Cook: <br>
                               Pour in the water or vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked and water is absorbed. <br><br>
                            
                            6. Fluff & Serve: <br>
                               Turn off the heat and let the rice sit for 5 minutes. Fluff it with a fork and garnish with fresh coriander/cilantro. <br><br>
                            
                            Serving Suggestions: <br>
                            - Serve hot with grilled chicken, beef stew, or vegetable curry. <br>
                            - Enjoy on its own with a side of kachumbari (tomato-onion salad) or plain yogurt. <br><br>

                            1. Cook the Spaghetti: <br>
                               Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside. <br><br>
                            
                            2. Sauté the Vegetables: <br>
                               Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Sauté for about 3-5 minutes until soft. <br><br>

                            - 2 tablespoons melted butter (or vegetable oil) <br>
                            - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract <br>
                            - Butter or oil for cooking <br><br>
                            
                            Instructions <br><br>
                            
                            1. Mix the Dry Ingredients: <br>
                               In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. <br><br>
                            
                            2. Mix the Wet Ingredients: <br>
                               In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until well combined. <br><br>
                            
                            3. Combine Wet & Dry Ingredients: <br>
                               Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay. <br><br>
                            
                            4. Heat the Pan: <br>
                               Place a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil. <br><br>
                            
                            5. Cook the Pancakes: <br>
                               Pour about ¼ cup of batter onto the pan for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set (about 2 minutes). Flip and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown. <br><br>
                            
                            6. Serve & Enjoy: <br>
                               Stack the pancakes on a plate and serve warm with syrup, honey, fresh fruits, or whipped cream. <br><br>
                            
                            Serving Suggestions: <br>

                            - Top with fresh strawberries, bananas, or blueberries. <br>
